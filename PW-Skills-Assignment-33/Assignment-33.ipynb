Ex) If we roll a fair dice then the probability of getting values till 4 will be probability of getting 1 plus probability of getting 2 plus probability of getting 3 plus probability of getting 4= 1/6+1/6+1/6+1/6= 4/6. The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a real-valued random variable X, evaluated at x, is the probability function that X will take a value less than or equal to x.

    "##### The two parameters of normal distribution are mean and standard deviation. The mean is located at the centre. The mean defines the location of the peak and most data points are clustered around mean. Most of the data of the random variable (following normal distribution) falls within 3 standard deviations from the mean. So, the standard deviation or variance determines the width of the curve. In this way these 2 parameters relate to the shape of the distribution. Using mean and standard deviation and calculating the y values for each data point(x) using gaussian function, the bell curve can be plotted."
